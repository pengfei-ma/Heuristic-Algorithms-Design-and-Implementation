# Heuristic-Algorithms-Design-and-Implementation

This project designed and implemented two heuristic algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph. For this project, basic concepts of graphs and basic (logical) representations of graphs were used. There are two input files: graph_input.txt and direct_distance.txt. 

The first input file contains structural information about the input graph. The program read the graph input file and store the information in an appropriate data structure. The graph_input.txt file contains a textual representation of a graph.

# How to Run

SimpleGraphRepresentation.java contained all code of the project.


# Files

graph_input.txt and small_graph.txt are the input files.

direct_distance.txt is the output file of the direct distance generated by the program.

Simple-graph-representation.docx is the result report from the program.
